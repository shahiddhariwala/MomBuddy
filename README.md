## Inspiration
**The underestimation of Postpartum Depression and its effects** – (Use Case)
Giving birth – when the most wonderful feeling in the world becomes
your worst nightmare. That’s what many new mothers face but are
ashamed to acknowledge or admit to anyone or even themselves.
We just want to say “ IT’S OK “ and we will deal with it TOGETHER.
Sometimes it’s difficult to discuss it with anyone even though one has
a thousand queries. It can be the hesitation or the lack of courage to do so or the fear that no one will understand what you’re going through.
That’s where MOMBUDDY will be your friend, philosopher and guide.
To cater to these problems we have built a companion and personal assistant called :
Elinora
 
## What it does
MomBuddy is a platform that makes the life of to be a mom or a new mother really easy. It can perform a range of different tasks. 
They are:
Talking to the mother when she’s going through something and probably is hesitant to talk about it to someone.
Helping her understand things she’s going through even when she is unable to understand it herself.
Prompting her to visit a doctor when it seems necessary and if she’s shy to do so.
Helping her book an appointment when she has made up her mind.
Answering her general baby related queries like fever, rashes, cold etc.
Entertaining her in interesting ways like letting her play a game on the bot which predicts her sentiment and makes her feel understood and entertained at the same time. It’s a little addictive really!
